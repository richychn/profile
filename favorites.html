                <h4>The Prestige</h4>
                <p>An illusion gone horribly wrong pits two 19th-century magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), against each other in a bitter battle for supremacy. Terrible consequences loom when the pair escalate their feud, each seeking not just to outwit -- but to destroy -- the other man.</p>

                <h4>Castle in the Sky</h4>
                <p>Young orphan Sheeta (Anna Paquin) and her kidnapper, Col. Muska (Mark Hamill), are flying to a military prison when their plane is attacked by a gang of air pirates led by the matronly Dola (Cloris Leachman). Escaping from a mid-air collision via a magic crystal around her neck, Sheeta meets fellow orphan Pazu (James Van Der Beek) and the pair join forces to discover the mystical floating city of Laputa while pursued by both Muska and the pirates, who lust for the city's myriad treasures.</p>

          <h4>Lindsey Stirling's Crystallize</h4>
          <p>One of the few musicians I've seen live. It's amazing how she dances while playing the violin.</p>

          <h3>My Favorite Restaurants Near Saldanha</h3>
          <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Restaurante Kathmandu</h4>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <p>When I first visited this restaurant with Le Wagon classmates, the food was very late, likely because we were a large group. However, I enjoyed the food and the price was average. I returned many times alone, and I never had to wait too long for the food again. Unlike many other restaurants in Lisbon, there is genuinely spicy food here. Furthermore, the staff are very nice and accomodating when I take out my laptop and use their free wifi on the dinner table. I would suggest my friends eat here at least once and decide for themselves.</p>
