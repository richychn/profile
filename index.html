          <h1>Richy Chen</h1>
          <h2>Programmer</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Richy Chen. I am a college student in California, USA, but I was born in New Zealand. At LeWagon, I am excited to acquire the skills I need to embark on entrepreneurial adventures, whether to build a simple website for organizations I am a part of or to land an internship at a startup. I would like to create something that changes how people read the news, so that readers can understand their political opposites in todayâ€™s polarized environment. In the future, I hope to work in the intersection of finance and technology.</p>

                <p>An illusion gone horribly wrong pits two 19th-century magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), against each other in a bitter battle for supremacy. Terrible consequences loom when the pair escalate their feud, each seeking not just to outwit -- but to destroy -- the other man.</p>

                <h3>Castle in the Sky</h3>
                <p>Young orphan Sheeta (Anna Paquin) and her kidnapper, Col. Muska (Mark Hamill), are flying to a military prison when their plane is attacked by a gang of air pirates led by the matronly Dola (Cloris Leachman). Escaping from a mid-air collision via a magic crystal around her neck, Sheeta meets fellow orphan Pazu (James Van Der Beek) and the pair join forces to discover the mystical floating city of Laputa while pursued by both Muska and the pirates, who lust for the city's myriad treasures.</p>
